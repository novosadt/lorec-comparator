# LoReC - Comparator: Optical Mapping and Hight-Throughput Sequencing Structural Variant Comparator

This software tool is designed to compare structural variants identified by various whole genome sequencing technologies, including optical mapping technology (Bionano Genomics) and high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies such as 10x Genomics, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and Pacific Biosciences. Structural variants generated by long-read next-generation sequencing and optical mapping technologies are analyzed using various variant callers available today.

The tool calculates distance and intersection variance measures between individual structural variants from the different technologies or variant callers being compared. It also offers several filtering options, including filters for overlapping genes, variant types, and distance variance. Additionally, the tool provides structural variant annotation from the dbVar and ClinVar databases.

The tool allows the analysis of multiple input files from the same technology or variant caller at once. Simply enter multiple file paths, separated by semicolons.

This tool is available as a platform-independent CLI application and is part of the Long-Read-Checker (LoReC) toolkit.

## Example of usage
Some basic example usage of structural variant comparator follows. More detailed usage with sample data and results are presented in sample package in <b>./example</b> directory in this repository. Each directory in sample package contains README.txt file where can be found detailed description of each file. Runnable binary version of the application is presented in <b>./bin</b> directory of the repository.

### Basic usage
In basic setup, application compares all SVs contained in input files. No filters are applied here.

```console
java -jar lorec-comparator.jar -vl "longranger_01.vfc;longranger_02.vcf" -vm "manta_01.vcf;manta_02.vcf;manta_03.vcf" -a annotsv.tsv -b bionano.smap -mi manta_01.vcf -o result.csv
```

### Distance Variance filter
Following command filters out variants which have distance variance greater than 50000 bases.

```consolev
java -jar lorec-comparator.jar -vl longranger.vcf -b bionano.smap -d 50000 -o result.csv 
```

### Overlapping genes filter
Following command filters out variants which have distance variance greater than 50000 bases and have no genes in overlap.

```console
java -jar lorec-comparator.jar -vl longranger.vcf -b bionano.smap -d 50000 -g -o result.csv 
```

### Variant type filter
Following command will analyze only translocations (BND), deletions (DEL) and insertions (INS). Other variant types are ignored.

```console
java -jar lorec-comparator.jar -vl longranger.vcf -b bionano.smap -t "BND,DEL,INS" -o result.csv 
```
